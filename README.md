### Hello! This is my final project which incorporates elements learnt during the Front-end Web Development Course at IT School.
### This site aims to be a presentation website for a law firm. It contains a Homepage, an About us page, another page about Expertise and last but not least a Contact page.
### Each page contains text areas like headers, paragraphs but also images.
### On the Contact page I have included a Contact Form which triggers an alert once the button is clicked.
### The header items & footer change color once you hover over them, the logo page sends you to the Homepage.
### I have chosen a specific color palette from colorhunt.co and a font from Google Fonts.
