# itschool-proiect-final-Bianca

# Hello! This is my final project which incorporates elements during the Front-end Web Development Course at IT School.
# This aims to be a presentation website for a law firm. It contains a Homepage, an About us page, another page about Expertise and last but not least a Contact page.
# Each of the pages contain text areas like headers, paragraphs but also images.
# On the Contact page I have included a contact form which triggers and alert once the button is clicked.
# The header items & footer change color once you hover over them, the logo page sends you to the Homepage.
# I have chosen a specific color pallete from colorhunt.co and a font from Google Fonts.
